Topic: Data Wrangling.
This lecture was designed to walk students through how to use joins and pivots for wrangling data as well as to discuss how to deal with NA data in R. 

Data from the Suisun Marsh Fish Study is included and used as a case study of these topics. 
The data is publicly available, however, the Durand lab group prefers to keep track of projects using the data. So if you have any plans to use this data for published works please reach out and contact Teejay O'Rear for consultation (taorear@ucdavis.edu). Using this data is perfectly acceptable for exploratory projects of your own. Please be sure to read the metadata document to fully understand the meanings of codes and values in the dataset. Requests for further tables from the database can be made by emailing me.
